==== SECTION 2 ====

Syntax Parser
- A program that reads your code and determines validity and executions.
- Translates human code to computer instructions

Lexical Environment
- Where something sits physically in the code you write

Execution Context
- A wrapper to help manage the code that is running
    1) Creation Phase on file.js load:
        Global
        - Stores functions or variables in memory

        Global Execution Context
        - Creates:
            1) Global Object === window object
            2) var this === window object

        Outer Environment
        - null at the Global level
    2) Execution Phase
        - Runs your code

Hoisting
- Setup of Memory Space for Variables and Functions to get ready for code to run
- Entire functions and contents are hoisted in memory
- Variable values have placeholders set in memory until code reaches it

Javascript & Undefined
- Undefined is a special value and a special keyword
- Value of variables when global execution context is run
- Stored in memory but value is not yet set
- "I've never set this value"
